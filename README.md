# iFertigateNa
Impact Hackathon2050

Through collaboration of concepts, the I-FertigateNa aims to equip local banana growers in  transition to Precision Agriculture. Through innovation of an IoT-Powered Smart Application through Remote Sensing Technology, we give access to precise information in banana crop monitoring and management boosting their yield and field productivity.



soil_sensor_et_gage.ino - This code contains the function for picking and translating data from the NPK sensors and ET Gage data into Arduino Module to iFertigateNa Smart Application.

real_time_clock.ino - This code contains the function for tracking real-time for the ET Gage Monitoring.

PWA IFertigateNa - This is the mobile application simulating the interface and flow of the whole system. This uses Progressive Web Application development.
